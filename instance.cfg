notes=Version 0.0.6 \nDescription\nThis patch is intended to clean up a lot of the chest that were left laying around the world so that there is more consistency among loot (Copper / Tin / etc.) in addition I wanted to make sure each core mod added a bit to the overall loot table to accomodate this chest.zs has been created and the Loottweaker mod installed. In addition it appears I was totally incorrect about Rustic not having support for the condenser, as such we now only have one type of bee in the world and the "Southern" bee has been removed. \n\nThe metals have been singled down to a single mod, legacy recipies have been left in place in the event one needs to transition from one to another. (eg immersive engineering copper plates no longer count as copper plates; however, they have a recipie that can convert them directly to ember's copper plates). \n\nModpack Core \n\nConfig Changes\n\t- Loading screen made a little more calming\n\t- Turned off rustic bee generation \n\t- Changing loot configuration for Ressurect Complex structures to better reflect loot from the modpack and encourage exploration. \nMod's Added\n\tHelper\n\t\t-Soot \n\tModpack\n\t\t-Loottweaker\n\t\t-Abyssalcraft Intergration \nMod's Updated\n\tCore\n\t\t-Astral Sorcery\n\t\t-Thaumcraft\n\tLibrary\n\t\t-Connected Textures Mod \n\tHelper\n\t\t-Storage Drawers]\n\t\t-Rustic\n\tUI\n\t\t-Clumps\n\t\t-JEI\n\tModpack \n\t\t-Crafttweaker\n\t\t-Better Questing \nMod's Removed\n\nQuesting\n\t-Altered Ember's copper quest to now focus on lead instead (Also introducing the hammer). \nScripting\n\t- Removed the renaming of the rustic bees and simply made it so Harvescraft bee related items would work  \n\t- Unified metal ingots / blocks /  Nuggets / Plates so that all machines only produce one type \n\t- Crusher has chance to make copper instead of nickel with Iron ore. \n\t- Nickel removed in it's entirety (If you have any left feel free to throw it away) \n
