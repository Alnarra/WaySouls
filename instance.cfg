notes=Version 0.0.6 \nDescription\nThis patch is intended to clean up a lot of the chest that were left laying around the world so that there is more consistency among loot (Copper / Tin / etc.) in addition I wanted to make sure each core mod added a bit to the overall loot table to accomodate this chest.zs has been created and the Loottweaker mod installed. In addition it appears I was totally incorrect about Rustic not having support for the condenser, as such we now only have one type of bee in the world and the "Southern" bee has been removed. \n\nModpack Core \n\nConfig Changes\n\t- splash.properties color scheme modified \n\t- Turned off rustic bee generation \nMod's Added\n\tHelper\n\t\t-Loottweaker\nMod's Updated\n\tUI\n\t\t-Clumps\n\t\t-JEI\n\tModpack \n\t\t-Crafttweaker\nMod's Removed\n\nQuesting\n\nScripting\n \t- Balance.zs added to help break out balance changes versus aestetic changes\n\t- Chest.zs added to help deal with loot issues\n\t- Removed the renaming of the rustic bees and simply made it so Harvescraft bee related items would work  \n\t\n\nVersion 0.0.5 \n\nDescription \nThis patch is intended to clean up a lot of the useless underground / ore clutter that was taking place. I noticed that a lot of the ores either utterly didn't serve a purpose, or that they were one off ores that had a single recipie. I've put a lot heavier emphasis on silver as a result. In addition I've added some baseline quest to help players get started on a number of quest. \n\nInfernal mobs was proving during playtesting to be iincredibly frustrating and there was no way I could make use of it without some form of griefing or simply feeling like in the early stages the player would be left hiding for their lives. This behavior was not intended. The Khndrel Keght (Dirt slime) was also removed as it felt like a silly punishment for using a non shovel to clear dirt\n\nWith rustic lacking support for Modtweaker in regards to alchemy, it is difficult to clean up the bee issue, and so the "Southern" bees need remain. Embers and Abyssalcraft's lack of support also leaves a few stray recipies here and there. \n\nTotemic has been added as a small support mod because I believe it fit the theme, and realbench is a QoL improvement. Nutrtion is intended to help reward the player \n\nModpack Core\n\t- Fixed the resource pack not being shipped with the client version (Whoopsie daisy) \n\nConfig Changes\n\t- Turned off Tomato / Chili Pepper generation for Harvestcraft (so Rustic can handle them) \n\t- Turned of RPG Hud Compass and Entity inspect \n\t- Toned down Abysallcraft biome generation by half (this should be as low as it can possibly go) \n\t- Turned off Khndrel Keght (Dire slime) from enderzoo \n\t- Turned off Bronze, Nickel from Embers\n\t- Turned off Thaumcraft Quartz Generation (Embers makes more then enough). \n\t- Turned off Uranium Ore generation \n\t- Prevented market from selling animals that can't spawn \n\nMod's Added\n\tHelper\n\t\t- Totemic \n\t\t- Realbench \n\t\t- Nutrition \nMods Updated\n\tCore\n\t\t- Abyssal Craft\n\t\t- Astral Sorcery \n\tLibrary\n\t\t- AutoRegLib\n\t\t- FTBLib\n\tHelper\t\n\t\t- Reliquery \n\t\t- Quark \n\tUI\n\t\t- JEI\n\t\t- Clumps \n\tModpack\n\t\t- FTBUtilities\nMod's Removed\n\tLibrary\n\t\t- B.A.S.E\n\tHelper\n\t\t- Infernal Mobs\n\nQuesting\n\t- Added images for quest booklet \n\t- Made a number of small updates to try and correct issues with the quest booklet \n\t- Added 100+ Quest to help the player begin to settle in \n \t- Bug where quest book was sent in edit mode should now be corrected\n\t- Numerous quest updated / rewards changed / etc. \n\nScripting\n\t- Removed Uranium from JEI / Recipies where possible\n\t- Removed Tin from JEI / Recipies where possible\n\t- Removed Mithril from JEI \n\t- Removed Constantan from JEI / Recipies where possible\n\t- Substituded Electrum for the two recipie which requires Constantan \n\t- Substituded Silver in the off chance that Tin is neede din Abyssalcraft\n\t- Changed Apple Juice recipie to not drop apple seeds\n\t- Removed references to Pam's Grapes / Tomatoes / Chilli Peppers\n\nModpack \n\t- Github profile page updated.
