notes=Version 0.0.6 \nDescription\nThis patch is intended to clean up a lot of the chest that were left laying around the world so that there is more consistency among loot (Copper / Tin / etc.) in addition I wanted to make sure each core mod added a bit to the overall loot table to accomodate this chest.zs has been created and the Loottweaker mod installed. In addition it appears I was totally incorrect about Rustic not having support for the condenser, as such we now only have one type of bee in the world and the "Southern" bee has been removed. \n\nThe metals have been singled down to a single mod, legacy recipies have been left in place in the event one needs to transition from one to another. (eg immersive engineering copper plates no longer count as copper plates; however, they have a recipie that can convert them directly to ember's copper plates). \n\nPlates have been balanced (including thaumcraft plates) requiring at minimum that you have a hammer from either immersive engineering or embers. In addition Totemic's whittling knife, because of it's ability to craft a small range beacon has had it's recipie reworked to require interacting with the other mods in the pack. \n\nModpack Core \n\t- Updated to Forge vs Version 14.23.5.2768\nConfig Changes\n\t- Loading screen made a little more calming\n\t- Turned off rustic bee generation \n\t- Changing loot configuration for Ressurect Complex structures to better reflect loot from the modpack and encourage exploration. \n\t- updated Battletowers loot \n\t- Turned off tin, Uranium, nickel, and few other chisel patterns that weren't relevant to help cut down on texture load times\n\t- turned off limestone generation (Quark already does it). \nMod's Added\n\tLibrary \n\t\t-Forgelin\n\t\t-Libex\n\tHelper\n\t\t- Soot \n\tModpack\n\t\t- Loottweaker\n\t\t- Abyssalcraft Intergration \nMod's Updated\n\tCore\n\t\t- Abyssalcraft\n\t\t- Blood Magic\n\t\t- Astral Sorcery\n\t\t- Thaumcraft\n\t\t- Immersive Engineering\n\t\t- Botania\n\tLibrary\n\t\t- Connected Textures Mod \n\t\t- FTB Lib\n\t\t- AutoRegLib \n\t\t- GuideAPI\n\tHelper\n\n\t\t- Storage Drawers\n\t\t- Rustic\n\t\t- Animania \n\t\t- Battletowers \n\t\t- Chisel\n\t\t- Cooking for Blockheads\n\t\t- Gravestone Mob\n\t\t- NetherEx\t\n\t\t- Quark \n\t\t- Reliquery \n\t\t- Totemic \n\t\t- Rustic\n\t\t- Waystones\n\tUI\n\t\t- Clumps\n\t\t- JEI\n\t\t- Just enough Resources\n\t\t- Better Foliage \n\t\t- Dynamic Surroundings\n\t\t- More Overlays \n\t\t- Mouse Tweaks \n\t\t- ThaumicJEI\n\tModpack \n\t\t- Crafttweaker\n\t\t- Better Questing \n\t\t- Standard Expansion\t\n\t\t- FTB Utilies \n\t\t- ModTweaker\nMod's Removed\n\nQuesting\n\t-Altered Ember's copper quest to now focus on lead instead (Also introducing the hammer). \t\n\t-Added a Totemic Questline\n\t-The simplicity of farming now accepts any fruit tree \nScripting\n\t- Removed the renaming of the rustic bees and simply made it so Harvescraft bee related items would work  \n\t- Unified metal ingots / blocks /  Nuggets / Plates so that all machines only produce one type \n\t- Crusher has chance to make copper instead of nickel with Iron ore. \n\t- Nickel removed in it's entirety (If you have any left feel free to throw it away) \n\t- Fixed loot generation so that there isn't such a wide variety of metals in the chest. \n\t- Balanced all plates in the game to require a hammer and a single ingot (or a stamper / metal press).\n\t- Vaccum tube recipie corrected to use silver instead of nickel
