Core Focus: 
Wayward Souls is a version 1.12 modpack that is attempting to stay with a lighthearted and very core approach. The focus will be on keeping a general aestetic as well as enhancing gameply by making the player feel like the world they are in is powered with ancient and powerful magics. Questing is in place to help the player understand any minor alterations made to the world from base minecraft as well as getting intot he bas. The modpack should meet high quality standards expected of Modpacks ensuring that player expirience is ranked first. The modpack should be kept up to date and also be visually appealing, the aeastic of the modpack should be concise and only mods which adhere to that aeastetic should be considered. 

Technology should be secondary to magic in terms of the overall look and feel.The general feeling should be one of good versus evil. Minimal considriations for extreme difficulty or Player versus player have been considered.

Anyway

The long and short of it is that I wanted a modpack that let me explore a few core mods that was still pretty to look at but didn't suffer from "Useless Stuff" syndrome (Something I find problematic about Biomes O' Plenty). I wanted every mod in the mod pack to matter in some small way, to have a fairly sizable impact. At this point, the only thing it's missing is an HQM Equivilant

I didn't want this pack to be nearly as difficult as my Tame the World Pack, and so it's difficulty curve is more relaxed. Horrible abominations will not come from beyond the world to murderlate you, but at the same time Embers, Enderzoo, and Abysalcraft should still keep you awake.

Also for the love of all that is holy, trying to keep one and only one kind of ore in the world. There is nothing that drives my OCD up a wall faster then 13 different kinds of lead ore.
