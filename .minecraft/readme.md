Description
------------
They say in a more ancient time that there were great and powerful spirits that guided the path of those who walked the square world. That there was a time when the very essence of magic is what controlled the living and the damned. Allow me to be your guide on an adventure to control the very nature of magic itself! We will walk amongst the stars and the depths of all the realms of hell. No land is without our touch! Join me as my apprentice as I teach you... the ways of magic

Wayward Souls is a light Modpack with a focus on teaching newer and younger players the various ways to progress through a number of popular magical mods. The intention is to provide the player with a simple and understandable aesthetic that isn't too cluttered with overlap between the various mods and ensures relative stability and compatibility while trying to also ensure that the various component mods remain up to date in coordination with mod authors. 

Inspired by Mage Quest and Minecraft Mage, the idea is to try and leave AS MUCH of the core Minecraft philosophy intact while adding new layers of adventure and difficulty. To help the player along a quest book (Provided through the Better Questing series of mods) is also provided.

Changelog 
============ 
Version 0.0.5 
-------------

###Description 
This patch is intended to clean up a lot of the useless underground / ore clutter that was taking place. I noticed that a lot of the ores either utterly didn't serve a purpose, or that they were one off ores that had a single recipie. I've put a lot heavier emphasis on silver as a result. In addition I've added some baseline quest to help players get started on a number of quest. 

Infernal mobs was proving during playtesting to be iincredibly frustrating and there was no way I could make use of it without some form of griefing or simply feeling like in the early stages the player would be left hiding for their lives. This behavior was not intended. The Khndrel Keght (Dirt slime) was also removed as it felt like a silly punishment for using a non shovel to clear dirt

With rustic lacking support for Modtweaker in regards to alchemy, it is difficult to clean up the bee issue, and so the "Southern" bees need remain. Embers and Abyssalcraft's lack of support also leaves a few stray recipies here and there. 

Totemic has been added as a small support mod because I believe it fit the theme, and realbench is a QoL improvement. Nutrtion is intended to help reward the player 

###Modpack Core
	- Fixed the resource pack not being shipped with the client version (Whoopsie daisy) 

###Config Changes
	- Turned off Tomato / Chili Pepper generation for Harvestcraft (so Rustic can handle them) 
	- Turned of RPG Hud Compass and Entity inspect 
	- Toned down Abysallcraft biome generation by half (this should be as low as it can possibly go) 
	- Turned off Khndrel Keght (Dire slime) from enderzoo 
	- Turned off Bronze, Nickel from Embers
	- Turned off Thaumcraft Quartz Generation (Embers makes more then enough). 
	- Turned off Uranium Ore generation
