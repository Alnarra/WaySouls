### Description
------------
They say in a more ancient time that there were great and powerful spirits that guided the path of those who walked the square world. That there was a time when the very essence of magic is what controlled the living and the damned. Allow me to be your guide on an adventure to control the very nature of magic itself! We will walk amongst the stars and the depths of all the realms of hell. No land is without our touch! Join me as my apprentice as I teach you... the ways of magic

Wayward Souls is a light Modpack with a focus on teaching newer and younger players the various ways to progress through a number of popular magical mods. The intention is to provide the player with a simple and understandable aesthetic that isn't too cluttered with overlap between the various mods and ensures relative stability and compatibility while trying to also ensure that the various component mods remain up to date in coordination with mod authors.

Inspired by Mage Quest and Minecraft Mage, the idea is to try and leave AS MUCH of the core Minecraft philosophy intact while adding new layers of adventure and difficulty. To help the player along a quest book (Provided through the Better Questing series of mods) is also provided.

Patch 0.3.3 
----
It's been a while since I've been at this right? Well My friends and I were trying to find a modpack that we actually enjoyed. Problematically, we can't find a 1.16.5 version that  doesn't either crash or piss us off. As such I have been tasked with updating this one, to at least the the most recent versions in 1.12.2. So here we  are. Thus, I am updating the pack.

Patch 0.3.2 - Hotfix 1

Patch 0.3.2
--------------------
This is to clean up a few bugs and add a quest chain or two. As a not top Server Owners you will likely get warnings about /fml confirm for a number of Mystical World Items, so this is a notation that that is to be expected. To help cut down on conflicts, a few recipes have been altered (see full list below)

Patch 0.3.1

	- Bewitchment

_Helper_

	- Arcane Archives
	- Charms

Patch 0.3.0
--------------------
This patch introduces a few minor mods to help spice up the world a little bit, it also introduces a new core mod (wizardry), which while I believe is not quite mature compared to the other core mods (save roots and nature's aura) it serves as mature enough to be worth inclusion

Note to take full advantage of both Charms and Wizardry you would need to create a new world or explore new chunks as both introduce world generation.

### Mods Updated:
_Core Mods_

	- Embers

Patch 0.1.0
---------------------

### Description

This patch will be addressing a number of small issues that are detected with the various quest throughout the book, attempting to squash bugs and adjust rewards as needed. In addition this will also focus on working more towards some server friendly changes (Hence Bed Rolls being removed in favor of comforts / etc.). At this point I am almost 100% set on the mods in place and more then happy with the overall weight and structure of the mod-pack, this simply becomes a polishing matter at this point. At this point I feel it is safe to describe the mod pack as no longer being in alpha but rather in the beta state. Note that several of the mods contained within are unfinished and thus are very much still considered beta (Thaumcraft / Nature's Aura); however, I feel that providing those mods with a pack in which to flourish topples any overarching need to hold the pack back.

Forge has been updated to compensate for requirements by comforts, and though it is not a stable release, in testing I haven't been able to produce any major bugs or issues.

Patch 0.0.7
-------------
### Description
This particular update is intended to take a more serious look at the quest book and some of the more problematic mods including totemic, abyssalcraft, and roots. The truth is that I wanted to tackle each of these but they all present their own unique difficulties whent it comes to quest surrounding them. As such I've tuned back the modification made to Totemic's central element opting to leave the mod intact. In addition this will begin to work on the abyssalcraft quest line. I will not touch the roots quest line until the newer version of the mod is published.

In addition to that, I will be working to try and include "Out of Character" information for each and every quest. This can include a number of things including why the quest exist in the first place, or how to accomplish the quest (as some can be more difficult to understand then others). I'm MOSTLY settled on the mods that are in place and feel comfortable simply updating them.

As development will now be handled through the twitch interface, you can assume that all mods are updated as updates become available.

This will be created as a new branch of the Github repo to help separate it.

Version 0.0.6
-------------
### Description
This patch is intended to clean up a lot of the chest that were left laying around the world so that there is more consistency among loot (Copper / Tin / etc.) in addition I wanted to make sure each core mod added a bit to the overall loot table to accomodate this chest.zs has been created and the Loottweaker mod installed. In addition it appears I was totally incorrect about Rustic not having support for the condenser, as such we now only have one type of bee in the world and the "Southern" bee has been removed.

The metals have been singled down to a single mod, legacy recipes have been left in place in the event one needs to transition from one to another. (eg immersive engineering copper plates no longer count as copper plates; however, they have a recipe that can convert them directly to ember's copper plates).

Plates have been balanced (including thaumcraft plates) requiring at minimum that you have a hammer from either immersive engineering or embers. In addition Totemic's whittling knife, because of it's ability to craft a small range beacon has had it's recipe reworked to require interacting with the other mods in the pack.

### Modpack Core

	- Updated to Forge vs Version 14.23.5.2768

### Config Changes

	- Loading screen made a little more calming
	- Turned off rustic bee generation
	- Changing loot configuration for Ressurect Complex structures to better reflect loot from the modpack and encourage exploration.
	- updated Battletowers loot

	- Crusher has chance to make copper instead of nickel with Iron ore.

	- Balanced all plates in the game to require a hammer and a single ingot (or a stamper / metal press).
	- Vaccum tube recipie corrected to use silver instead of nickel

Version 0.0.5
-------------

### Description
This patch is intended to clean up a lot of the useless underground / ore clutter that was taking place. I noticed that a lot of the ores either utterly didn't serve a purpose, or that they were one off ores that had a single recipie. I've put a lot heavier emphasis on silver as a result. In addition I've added some baseline quest to help players get started on a number of quest.

Infernal mobs was proving during playtesting to be iincredibly frustrating and there was no way I could make use of it without some form of griefing or simply feeling like in the early stages the player would be left hiding for their lives. This behavior was not intended. The Khndrel Keght (Dirt slime) was also removed as it felt like a silly punishment for using a non shovel to clear dirt

With rustic lacking support for Modtweaker in regards to alchemy, it is difficult to clean up the bee issue, and so the "Southern" bees need remain. Embers and Abyssalcraft's lack of support also leaves a few stray recipies here and there.

Totemic has been added as a small support mod because I believe it fit the theme, and realbench is a QoL improvement. Nutrtion is intended to help reward the player

### Modpack Core

	- Fixed the resource pack not being shipped with the client version (Whoopsie daisy)

### Config Changes

	- Turned off Tomato / Chili Pepper generation for Harvestcraft (so Rustic can handle them)
	- Turned of RPG Hud Compass and Entity inspect
	- Toned down Abysallcraft biome generation by half (this should be as low as it can possibly go)
	- Turned off Khndrel Keght (Dire slime) from enderzoo
	- Turned off Bronze, Nickel from Embers
	- Turned off Thaumcraft Quartz Generation (Embers makes more then enough).
	- Turned off Uranium Ore generation
	- Prevented market from selling animals that can't spawn
